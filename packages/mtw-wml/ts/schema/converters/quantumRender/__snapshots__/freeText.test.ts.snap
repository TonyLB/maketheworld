"A short first section <Link to=(clockTower)>clockTower</Link> then a long enough
second section that it will start testing the word-wrap functionality at eighty
characters, which is actually quite a long line indeed, eighty characters is a
lot more than you might think<Link to=(clockTower)>
    clockTower
</Link>and then a third section also snuggled up to the link, to test that
wrapping functionality doesn't separate no-space connections. Then a section
with two<Link to=(clockTower)>
    clockTower
</Link><Link to=(clockTower)>
    clockTower
</Link>tags directly adjacent. Finally a long text section to make sure that
wrapping still works when the text is adjacent after a nested tag."
