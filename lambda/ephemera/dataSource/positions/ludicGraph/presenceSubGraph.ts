/**
 * Tier: Prototype, not locked. Built because building it is the only affordable way to get
 * the evidence PR-8 (see taskPlanning/lambda/ephemera/dataSource/positions/AGENT.presence.planning.md)
 * needs.
 *
 * Dependency tag --- the rollback set is exactly:
 *   - positions/ludicGraph/presenceSubGraph.ts (+ test)
 *   - positions/ludicCache/mergeReducer.ts (+ test)
 *   - their fixtures
 * No change to EphemeraLudicGraph, to ephemeraMeta.ts, or to any write path. If a slice finds
 * it needs one, that is a scope change to raise, not to take.
 *
 * Rollback trigger, named in advance: a bucket cannot be stated from the child's own graph
 * plus its ports --- i.e. if deciding which nodes are in a binding turns out to require the
 * parent's graph, then presence is not port-indexed and the reducer's premise fails.
 *
 * Not triggers: fixture verbosity, reducer size, or the number of cases the straddle rule
 * needs. Those are measurements this Prototype exists to take.
 *
 * See taskPlanning/lambda/ephemera/dataSource/positions/AGENT.ludicCacheReducer.planning.md
 * for the plan this file implements.
