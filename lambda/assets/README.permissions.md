# Permissions Layer

The Permissions layer stores permission and access information to control what characters
and assets a player has access to

---

## Needs Addressed

- The system needs to be able to grant access to characters and assets with the following
granularity:
    - Play
    - Read
    - Edit Base
    - ?Edit Layer?
    - Grant
- The system needs to be able to associate grants with either a player, or with a character
or story (so that permissions are granted *in the context of that character or story* while
the player is associated with them)

*To Be Determined*
